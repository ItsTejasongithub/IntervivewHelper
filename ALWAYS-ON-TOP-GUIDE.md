# Always-On-Top & Transparency Guide

## ✅ What's Implemented:

### 1. **Transparency Control** (Built-in)
- Open **Settings** (⚙️ icon in the app)
- Use the **Transparency slider**
- Range: 30% (very transparent) to 100% (solid)
- Adjust in real-time!

### 2. **Always-On-Top Solution**

#### Option A: Chrome Flag (Basic - Already Working)
The app uses `--always-on-top` Chrome flag. It works but has limitations when clicking other windows.

#### Option B: AutoHotkey (Recommended - Best Solution!)
Install AutoHotkey for **persistent always-on-top** that works even when clicking Zoom/Teams.

**Installation Steps:**
1. Download AutoHotkey: https://www.autohotkey.com/download/
2. Install AutoHotkey v2 or v1.1
3. Double-click `launch-app.bat` - AutoHotkey will start automatically!

**AutoHotkey Features:**
- ✅ Window stays on top even when clicking Zoom/Teams/Meet
- ✅ Auto-detects the AI Assistant window
- ✅ Hotkey: `Ctrl+Alt+T` to toggle always-on-top for any window
- ✅ Hotkey: `Ctrl+Alt+Q` to exit the helper script

## 💡 Tips:

### Best Transparency Settings:
- **100%** - Fully visible (recommended when not sharing screen)
- **85%** - Slightly see-through, good balance
- **60%** - Very transparent, can see content behind

### Positioning:
- Drag the window by the **purple header bar**
- Position on the right/left edge of screen
- Doesn't block your video during interviews

### During Interviews:
1. Start Zoom/Teams/Meet
2. Launch AI Interview Assistant
3. Position window where it doesn't block your face
4. Adjust transparency so you can still read while seeing your notes behind
5. Start listening when interview begins!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

### Window goes behind when clicking?
- **Solution 1**: Install AutoHotkey (see above)
- **Solution 2**: Press `Ctrl+Alt+T` on the app window to force always-on-top
- **Solution 3**: Use a second monitor for the assistant

### Can't see the window?
- It might be too transparent! Open Settings and increase opacity to 100%

### Window disappeared?
- Check if it's off-screen - drag it back or restart the app

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts:

With AutoHotkey installed:
- `Ctrl+Alt+T` - Toggle always-on-top for current window
- `Ctrl+Alt+Q` - Exit AutoHotkey helper script

## 📝 Alternative Solutions:

If you don't want to install AutoHotkey:

### PowerToys FancyZones (Microsoft)
1. Install PowerToys: https://aka.ms/getPowerToys
2. Enable "Always on Top" module
3. Hotkey: `Win+Ctrl+T` to pin any window

### Manual Toggle
Right-click the Chrome app window title bar and look for "Always on top" option (if available)

## 🎯 Recommended Setup for Interviews:

1. **Transparency**: 85%
2. **Position**: Right edge of screen
3. **Size**: Default (450x700)
4. **Mode**: Personalized (with your resume loaded)
5. **AutoHotkey**: Running in background

This setup gives you:
- ✅ Answers visible over Zoom/Teams
- ✅ Can still see meeting participants
- ✅ Natural looking (not obviously reading)
- ✅ Quick access to technical details

---

## ✨ Example Workflow:

1. Launch app before interview
2. Join Zoom/Teams meeting
3. AI Assistant floats on top
4. Interviewer asks: "Tell me about your Arduino projects?"
5. AI shows: "I built a 5-DOF robotic arm with servo motors..."
6. You read and answer naturally!

**Pro tip**: Adjust transparency during screen sharing - make it 50-60% transparent so your audience can't see it clearly but you still can!
